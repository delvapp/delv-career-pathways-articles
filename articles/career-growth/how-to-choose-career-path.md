## Step 1: Self-Assessment

Before exploring career options, it’s important to understand yourself. Self-assessment involves reflecting on:

- **Interests:** What activities or subjects naturally excite you? What do you enjoy doing in your free time?
- **Skills and Strengths:** Identify your technical skills, soft skills, and talents. What tasks do you perform well or receive praise for?
- **Values:** Consider what matters most to you in a job — work-life balance, creativity, job security, social impact, or income potential.
- **Personality and Preferences:** Are you more introverted or extroverted? Do you enjoy teamwork or working independently?

**Tip:** Use online tools like personality tests (e.g., Myers-Briggs) or career assessments to gain deeper insights.

- **Growth and Opportunities:** Evaluate the demand, future prospects, and opportunities for advancement in each field.
- **Learning and Qualification Requirements:** Understand the education, certifications, or training needed for each role.
- **Work Environment and Culture:** Research company culture, work-life balance, and typical work settings.

**Tip:** Conduct informational interviews, attend career fairs, or seek mentorship to gain first-hand knowledge about potential careers.
